**Workshop on AI for Computational Social Science**  
**Time:** Nov 12â€“15, 2025  
**Location:** Washington, D.C.

Welcome to the official website of the **Workshop on AI4CSS at ICDM 2025**. This workshop aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and social science fields (e.g., sociology, psychology, political science, economics) to harness cutting-edge AI technologies for advancing our understanding of the social world.

We bring together scholars and practitioners working at the intersection of AI, data mining, and social science to explore how methodological innovations can drive scientific discovery and how social insights can guide the responsible use of AI.
