Welcome to the official website of the **Workshop on AI for Computational Social Science at ICDM 2025**. The AI for Computational Social Science workshop fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and social science fields (e.g., sociology, psychology, political science, economics, etc.) to leverage cutting-edge technological innovations in advancing our understanding of the social world.

This event will bring together researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of AI, data mining, and social science to discuss how methodological advancements can drive social science innovations, as well as how social science insights can, in turn, inform ethical considerations of technological progress. We invite original research submissions that apply or develop computational methods to analyze large-scale data, uncovering complex patterns in social interactions and human behavior.
